This is a lab for the intro iOS class.  

The goal was to learn about autosizing and orientation.  We were shown a vertical display that we needed to create ourselves.  We were then shown a horizontal display that our app needed to reproduce upon being rotated. 

Colors were optional - they may not be pretty, but at least you can see the different elements we were working on!

Done as a paired-programming exercise with Mike.
